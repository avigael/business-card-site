# Business Card Website Template

I create this website to function like a business card would. It's meant to be used as a static website where you can display basic information like your name, company, logo, and contact links. This is a very small and easy to edit website so feel free to use this code for yourself.

You can checkout the code in action [here](https://avigael.github.io/business-card-site/ "demo").
